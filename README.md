# Daily-Information-App
The application provides the user with content from either the "facts" or "quotes" category every day. The user can access content from only one category per day. The purpose of presenting only one piece of content per day is to prevent the user from overwhelming the application at once and to ensure continuity. Additionally, it is believed that presenting one piece of content per day allows for better digestion and appreciation of the material.

Development Environment: The application was created in the Android Studio development environment.
Programming Language: Java was preferred as the basic programming language of the application.
Database Operations: The application uses the SQLite database to store and manage user data. There is a SQLite library available as part of the Android SDK to interact with the SQLite database in Android Studio.
